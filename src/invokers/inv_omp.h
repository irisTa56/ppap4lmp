/*!
  @brief InvOMP is an Invoker's subclass using OpenMP to execute
  a computationally expensive part of analysis.

  This class executes a computationally expensive calculation,
  such as an updating process defined by Generator::update_chain
  or analytical computations conducted in Processor::run_impl,
  under multithread environment using OpenMP.
  All threads are used if `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable is
  not set.

  @note
    Please be careful when you modify any member of any object
    in a multithreading context!!

  About usage in Python,
  please see pybind::py_inv_omp.

      List of Processor objects to be executed.

    This method calls Processor::run in parallel. Note that exceptions
    (runtime errors) thrown inside the parallel scope must be caught
    in the same scope.
    Since error messages thrown in the parallel scope are assigned
    to a thread-global variable, older error messages are overwritten
    by newer one thrown in another thread.
