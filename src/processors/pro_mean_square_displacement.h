  @brief ProMeanSquareDisplacement computes mean square displacement
  (MSD).

  An object of this class makes a two-dimensional array
  of squared displacements from initial position for each target
  (can be an atom, bead, molecule...) over a simulation trajectory.
  Each row of the array corresponds to each snapshot of a simulation,
  and each column of the array corresponds to each target.
  By averaging over columns of the array, the object of this class
  also makes a one-dimensional array for the mean square displacement.

  About usage in Python,
  please see pybind::py_pro_mean_square_displacement.
