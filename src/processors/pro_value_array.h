  @brief ProValueArray makes one or more arrays consisting of values

  An object of this class makes one or more two-dimensional arrays
  consisting of values for property of Element objects stored
  in #generators. These arrays are useful for calculating statistics
  of property added by Adder's subclass.

  About usage in Python,
  please see pybind::py_pro_value_array.
