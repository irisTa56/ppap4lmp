  @brief FilSet applies a filter defined by sets of acceptable values.

  An object of this class has a filter defined by #value_sets,
  which is a dictionary consisting of pairs of a string key
  and a set of acceptable values.

  An element of array Element::data can pass this filter
  only if every value for every key in #value_sets is
  included in the corresponding set (a value of #value_sets).

  About usage in Python,
  please see pybind::py_fil_set.
