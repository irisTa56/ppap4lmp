  @brief FilComparison applies a filter
  defined by comparison operators.

  An object of this class has a filter defined by #comparisons,
  which is a list consisting of tuples where the first element is
  a string key, the second element is a comparison operator and
  the third element is a right side value of an inequality
  (or equation). Currently supported operators are
  `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`.

  An element of array Element::data can pass this filter
  only if every value for every key in #comparisons satisfies
  an inequality consisting of the corresponding comparison operator
  and right side value (the second and third elements of #comparisons).
  Note that value(s) of the item is taken as left side value of
  the inequality.

  About usage in Python,
  please see pybind::py_fil_comparison.
